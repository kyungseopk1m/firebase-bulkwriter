# firebase-bulkwriter
Example for firebase bulkwriter.

I wrote it, so you can edit it in your own way as needed.
<br>
Used Nodejs 18.14.2, no used framework.

## Running server

The json file related to firebase-adminsdk is required in the config folder.

Put the file in the config folder, create '.env' in the top root, and enter the absolute path by copying the json file in FIREBASE_CONFIG.
